## Type
Representative / composite scenario (educational)

## Topics
Working capital • cash conversion cycle • liquidity discipline

## Scenario
A growing business reports higher sales and stable margins, yet cash is tightening. Receivables are aging, inventory is rising, and suppliers are applying pressure.

## Decision tension
- How to stabilize liquidity without destroying growth?
- Which levers matter first: AR, inventory, supplier terms, pricing, financing?

## Framework
1. Quantify the cash trapped in AR and inventory (CCC).
2. Segment customers and SKUs to find root causes.
3. Implement a 30–60 day liquidity cadence with owners and thresholds.
4. Reset commercial guardrails (terms, approvals, pricing discipline).
5. Use financing only as a bridge—not as a substitute for discipline.
